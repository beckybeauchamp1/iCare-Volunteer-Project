# Evaluation Notes

Back-end Technology: **Preforming**

>Great job working through your challenges and creating a 2 model crud application!

Font-end Technology: **Preforming**

>Good job implementing a custom form directive and using ui router to show different states. I would go back and just look at your code to see how much of your controller functions/methods you are using in your views.

Code Quality: **Progressing**

>You definitely made a lot of progress since we first met! However, there is still some code that isn't functional and not necessarily following convention. For example, I would take out any controller functions, methods, or states your not using.
Also, just remember to separate your CSS and fix your html <head> and <title> for the indicated views.

Deployment and Functionality: **Preforming**

>Kudos to getting your app deployed! The only major error I encountered was trying to add a new story, but hopefully my changes now should help to fix it :)

Planning: **Preforming**

>I know you all had plenty of planning documentation, just remember to put it into your planning directory for employers.
