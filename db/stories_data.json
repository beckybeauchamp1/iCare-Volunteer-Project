Each Thanksgiving and Christmas I volunteer with my family serving meals to homeless. Taking time to help those less fortunate reminds me to be grateful for all that I have, and to always give back."},

I volunteer to ensure every kid in DC does!"},

Volunteering is important to me because at the end of the day, making time to step out of your own head, consider the plight of others and make a difference, however big or small, to improve their lives, is a powerful feeling and can make a powerful impact on others. We all have talents, skills and resources to share with others and by spending our time giving back, we not only help others, but can help kick-start a contagious cycle of spreading kindness to those around us - and there is nothing more valuable than that."},

In Ann Arbor, I co-chaired a child advocacy seminar, which aimed to empower middle-schoolers in an underserved neighborhood to advocate for their own health and wellness. We led seminars on nutritious food options, the importance of fitness and finding an enjoyable form of exercise and how to stay safe on the internet. The experience taught me that there is a large disparity in the health education provided to children and the opportunities for healthy living. For example, this particular neighborhood is a food desert and most of the families get their groceries from local convenience stores with limited fresh food, so we tried to focus our nutrition seminar on healthy options at convenience stores or fast food restaurants. Further, most of the children expressed that they are not allowed to play outside by themselves, due to safety concerns, which limits their opportunities for exercise. Our goal was to teach children opportunities for wellness within the confines of their environment."},

I find the volunteer experience very rewarding, because I know without my efforts, the state would take over as my client's guardian.  It's very easy to think this person's unfortunate situation could never happen to me or to a loved one.  Yet, I am continually reminded I am no different and no better than my clients.

It's very easy as a student or a broke, young yuppie (which I've been for most of the last six years) to focus one's time and resources inward, toward important but selfish efforts like making and meeting friends or studying.  It's vital--and incredibly refreshing--to spend a little time regularly projecting your talents outward, affecting and improving someone else's life."},

This volunteer experience was invaluable to me as I was able to play a small part in providing a safe space where children could be children and mothers could receive the support and respect they deserve."}
